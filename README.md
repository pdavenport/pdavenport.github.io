## hello hello

if you're reading this you're probably checking out some coding I've done

As of writing this I have to give big credit to Jhey (https://twitter.com/jh3yy). His posts give me more inspiration than most others I've come across.

This Website serves as a little portfolio for work gone by and work to come. Most of my work unfortunately has to live behind NDAs and in private repos but feel free to contact me with any questions :]

## ingrain in yourself a large gratitude for tiny moments of joy
